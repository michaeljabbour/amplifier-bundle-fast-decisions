# Policy configuration reference

Every key `Policy.from_config(config: dict)` accepts (`amplifier_fast_decisions/contracts.py::Policy`),
in one place. `from_config` silently ignores unrecognized keys (it filters
by `cls.__dataclass_fields__`); a typo in a key name here is a silent
no-op, not an error -- double-check spelling against this table. Keys
inside a nested dict (`effort_routing`, `model_routing`, `confidence_gates`)
ARE validated and DO raise `ValueError` on an unknown sub-key or an
out-of-range value (see `contracts.validate_effort_routing`,
`validate_model_routing`, `validate_confidence_gates`).

## Top-level keys

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"shadow"` | `"off"` / `"shadow"` / `"active"`. Only `"active"` can submit a fast-path candidate; `"shadow"` scores but always routes slow. |
| `timeout_ms` | `750` | Single cooperative deadline covering candidate collection, backend inference, and revalidation for one decision. Also the deadline HC05's judge asks (and HC08's batched ask) are bounded by. |
| `min_probability` | `0.90` | Legacy alias for `confidence_gates["read_shortcut"]` (HC09) -- still the default source when that key is absent. |
| `min_margin` | `0.20` | Minimum gap between the selected candidate's probability and the next-highest alternative. Independent of HC09's gates; always enforced alongside them. |
| `max_fast_streak` | `3` | Consecutive fast submissions allowed before forcing a slow route. |
| `max_fast_per_turn` | `12` | Total fast submissions allowed in one turn. |
| `max_candidates` | `12` | Candidates considered per decision (1..63). |
| `max_questions` | `8` | Contributed judgment questions considered per decision (0..64). |
| `max_state_chars` | `12000` | Canonical-JSON size budget for the state sent to the backend (512..100000). Also bounds HC05's judge state (`orchestrator._judge_state`). |
| `allow_external_state` | `False` (env override: `FAST_DECISIONS_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_STATE`) | Required, alongside an external backend (`backend.external == True`, e.g. Jev), before ANY external call is attempted -- read-shortcut, HC05 judge asks, and HC08 batched asks all honor this identical gate. |
| `allow_synthetic_active` | `False` | Whether an explicitly synthetic backend result (`synthetic=True`, e.g. `ScriptedBackend`) may be submitted in `active` mode. |
| `allowed_tools` | `("fast_workspace",)` | Tools a prepared candidate may target. |
| `shadow_max_messages` | `12` | Messages read for a shadow snapshot. |
| `shadow_snapshot_budget_ms` | `25` | Wall-clock budget for the shadow snapshot (1..5000). |
| `suppress_completed_reads` | `True` | HC02a: drop `fast_workspace` read/list candidates whose `(path, revision)` this turn already read. |
| `effort_routing` | `None` | HC03/HC05, opt-in. See below. |
| `model_routing` | `None` | HC04/HC05, opt-in. See below. |
| `decision_batching` | `False` | HC08, opt-in. Combine the HC05 phase-judge and escalation-judge asks into one `ask_many()` call whenever both are due for the same request. No effect when fewer than two judge mechanisms are configured. |
| `confidence_gates` | `None` | HC09, opt-in. See below. |
| `tool_risk_shadow` | `False` | HC11, opt-in. Ask a batched destructive/touches_production/category classification BEFORE each tool call and record a `fast_decisions:tool_risk` receipt. Never blocks, modifies, or approves anything -- native approvals remain authoritative. |
| `version` | `"policy-v1"` | Recorded verbatim on every receipt (`policy_version`). Not validated against a known set. |

## `effort_routing` (HC03/HC05, opt-in; `None`/`{}` = off)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `orient` / `explore` / `implement` | unset (no override for that phase) | One of `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`. |
| `max_explore_requests` | unset | Positive int; escalates effort after this many explore-phase requests. |
| `escalate_after_provider_errors` | unset | Positive int. |
| `phase_judge` | `False` | HC05: ask the configured `DecisionBackend` to classify the phase instead of trusting `effort.classify_phase` alone. A non-null, gate-passing answer overrides the deterministic phase for the rest of this request. Gated by `confidence_gates["phase"]` (HC09; default gate `0.0` -- byte-identical to pre-HC09 "any non-abstain answer applies"). |

## `model_routing` (HC04/HC05, opt-in; `None` = off; an explicit `{}` is invalid -- `start_model` is required)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `start_model` | required | The cheaper/faster model a turn starts pinned to. |
| `start_effort` | unset | One of the `ALLOWED_EFFORTS` strings. |
| `max_requests_before_escalation` | unset | Positive int; escalates after this many slow requests in the turn. |
| `escalate_on_test_failure` | `False` | Escalate the first time `ObservedTool.execute` observes a failing test-tool result this turn. |
| `escalate_on_provider_error` | `False` | Escalate on any upstream provider exception. |
| `override_explicit_model` | `False` | Whether an explicit `request.model` set by the host is overridden by `start_model` anyway. |
| `escalation_judge` | `"rules"` | `"rules"` (deterministic triggers only), `"judge"` (HC05: ask the configured backend a single Choice question past the turn's first slow request, while not yet escalated by a deterministic trigger), or `"decomposed"` (HC10: ask five atomic yes/no signals in one batched call and combine them in code via a weighted sum -- see below). |
| `escalate_min_probability` | `0.7` | Legacy alias for `confidence_gates["escalation"]` (HC09) -- still the default source when that key is absent. Also the gate HC10's weighted score is compared against. |
| `escalation_weights` | `DEFAULT_ESCALATION_WEIGHTS` (see below) | HC10, opt-in. Per-signal weight override, merged over the defaults (a partial dict only overrides the signals it names). Unknown signal names or out-of-range values (`[0, 1]`) raise `ValueError`. |

## `confidence_gates` (HC09, opt-in; `None` = every kind uses its legacy default)

| Key | Default when present | Legacy fallback when the whole policy omits `confidence_gates`, or omits this key |
|---|---|---|
| `read_shortcut` | (no built-in default -- must be set explicitly to apply) | `min_probability` (`0.90`) |
| `phase` | (no built-in default -- must be set explicitly to apply) | `0.0` (no gate; any non-abstain judge answer applies -- the pre-HC09 behavior) |
| `escalation` | (no built-in default -- must be set explicitly to apply) | `model_routing.escalate_min_probability` (`0.7`) |

Each value must be a number in `(0, 1]`. A key present in `confidence_gates`
always overrides its legacy alias, even if the legacy alias is also
explicitly set. See `contracts.effective_gate(policy, kind)` -- the single
resolver every call site (`DecisionService.choose`, the HC05 phase/escalation
judges, whether asked sequentially or via HC08 batching) consults.

Recommended explicit configuration, once the head-to-head study in
`evals/STUDY-DESIGN.md` section 14 and `evals/DESIGN-BRIDGE.md` rule (d2)
confirms a stake-scaled floor beats the flat legacy defaults for a given
mechanism:

```yaml
confidence_gates:
  read_shortcut: 0.7
  phase: 0.6
  escalation: 0.9
```

These are illustrative, not a shipped default -- `confidence_gates`
defaults to `None`, and every kind's legacy fallback is unchanged until a
human ratifies otherwise (see `evals/DESIGN-BRIDGE.md`'s "for human
ratification" framing).

## `escalation_weights` default (HC10, `model_routing.escalation_judge: "decomposed"`)

Five atomic signals, each an independent yes/no probability, combined via
`score = sum(weight[signal] * probability[signal])`:

| Signal | Default weight | Question |
|---|---|---|
| `tests_failing` | `0.30` | Tests or checks are failing after edits. |
| `repeated_tool_errors` | `0.25` | The last tool results contain repeated errors or failures. |
| `plan_derailed` | `0.20` | The agent is repeating itself or has abandoned the stated plan. |
| `beyond_tier` | `0.15` | The task needs deeper reasoning than a fast model reliably provides. |
| `unfamiliar_code` | `0.10` | The task requires understanding code the agent has not read. |

`score >= gate + 0.1` escalates; `score <= gate - 0.1` continues on the
cheap model; the band in between (`gate - 0.1 < score < gate + 0.1`) is
deliberately left "uncertain" and not acted on -- the deterministic
triggers (`escalate_on_test_failure`, `max_requests_before_escalation`,
`escalate_on_provider_error`) remain a floor regardless. See
`docs/EVENTS.md`'s `escalation_signals` receipt and orchestrator.py's HC10
section for the full mechanism.
