"""Efficiency receipts: one auditable record per optimization decision.

Every decision that changes what a step costs (a prepared action instead of a
model call, a cheaper model for a step, a kept-warm cache, a blocked helper
launch, a loop stopped early, a right-sized context) emits a
``fast_decisions:efficiency`` event carrying:

* ``lever`` and ``mechanism`` -- what kind of efficiency, and which judge, rule
  or mechanism decided it (``jev:task_difficulty``, ``rule:prompt_length``, ...);
* ``decision`` -- what was decided;
* ``baseline`` / ``actual`` -- calls, cost and seconds for the same step on the
  default model versus what actually ran, both fixed at decision time;
* ``calls_saved``, ``usd_saved``, ``seconds_saved`` -- baseline minus actual
  (negative when the decision cost more), and ``method`` -- how the baseline
  was estimated;
* ``project`` and ``traffic`` (``production`` or ``test``).

Because the savings are fixed in the receipt, dashboard totals are plain sums
over stored records: :func:`aggregate` (used by the dashboard and ``afast
efficiency``) and any independent re-sum give the same numbers. Test,
development and benchmark traffic is marked at the source and excluded from
production totals by default.
